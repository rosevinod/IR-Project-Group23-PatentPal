[ 0031 ] fig5 shows a modification in which the upper end portions 19 and 19 ′ of the levers 14 and 14 ′ are bent or cranked towards one another so that they can be mounted directly on one another at 15 ′, that is to say without the intervening bearing shaft 15 , as in the embodiment of fig3 . [ 0032 ] fig6 shows a further modified construction in which the spring bridge corresponds to that in the embodiment of fig1 to 3 . the sliding body 10 ′ and the optical guide plate 3 ′ are , however , of different construction . a projection 20 on the optical guide plate 3 ′ projects in the distal direction into a recess 21 in the sliding body 10 ′. the bearings for the lower free ends of the straight levers 14 and 14 ′ are situated on the projection 20 and the sliding body 10 ′, respectively . when the sliding body 10 ′ engages the optical guide plate 3 ′, the straight levers 14 and 14 ′ are in alignment , when viewed from the side , even without the bent lower ends 18 and 18 ′, as in fig4 . [ 0033 ] fig7 is a perspective view of a spring bridge in which the lever 14 ′ corresponds to that in the embodiment in fig1 to 3 . the lever 14 ′ is mounted by means of an upper bearing , as in the embodiment described above , on the bearing shaft 15 , around which the helical spring 16 is situated . the other lever 24 is , however , of two - arm construction . the arms are connected together by a transverse strut 28 in order to increase stability and have respective upper bearings and lower bearings 27 . the two upper bearings are mounted on respective ends of the bearing shaft 15 and , the two bearings 27 are mounted on both sides of the optical guide plate 3 , diametrically opposed . a three point mounting is thus produced of the spring bridge on the resectoscope with the three bearings 17 ′, 27 , 27 . in the illustrated embodiments , the spring bridge is arranged between the sliding body 10 and the optical guide plate 3 . in other embodiments , the spring bridge can also be arranged between the sliding body 10 and the main body 1 , with the construction being otherwise the same . resectoscopes are thus possible of both known types with an “ active transporter ” and a “ passive transporter ”. the resectoscope shown in fig1 to 3 corresponds to the construction with an active transporter . an expanding or opening spring is provided between the levers 14 and 14 ′ in the illustrated embodiments . it can also be a closing spring . thus , for instance , in the embodiment of fig1 in order to ensure the same operability , instead of a spring bridge with an expanding spring between the sliding body 10 and optical guide plate 3 , a spring bridge with a closing spring can be provided between the main body 1 and sliding body 10 . instead of the helical spring 16 shown in the figures , other types of opening or closing spring can be provided between the levers which do not extend around the illustrated bearing shaft 15 but which are provided , for instance , directly between the levers . in the illustrated embodiments of fig1 to 6 , the two levers 14 , 14 ′ engage the endoscope on different sides . in a modification , which is not illustrated , they can , however , be constructed to engage the same side . obviously , numerous further modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in the light of the above teachings . it is , therefore , to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practised otherwise than as specifically described herein .']\n",
            "['US-6125875-A', 'General tagging of new or cross-sectional technology', 'a faucet includes a valve body having inlet conduits and an outlet . there is a valve control element within the valve body to control flow from the inlet conduits to the outlet . a vacuum breaker hub is mounted on the valve body and forms a chamber with the exterior of the valve body . the valve body outlet opens into the chamber . there is a vacuum breaker system on the hub which includes a plurality of openings in the hub communicating with the chamber . there is a flexible valve element on the inside of the hub which normally closes the openings . there are ribs within the chamber , extending inwardly from the hub which ribs are on opposite sides of the vacuum breaker openings to preclude the flow of fluid from the valve body outlet to the area of the chamber about the flexible valve element .', 'fig1 illustrates a pullout wand faucet , customarily found in the kitchen and which includes a receptor indicated generally at 10 which has a spout support portion 12 which will receive the faucet wand , not shown . the hose for the faucet wand is indicated at 14 in broken lines and extends through the faucet assembly from the wand down to the area beneath the sink deck . the receptor 10 , which may be formed of plastic or of a metallic material , and which will be decorative in nature , encloses the valve body assembly and is mounted for rotation upon a bearing member 16 . the bearing member 16 in turn is seated upon an escutcheon 18 which is in the form of a ring , and is illustrated in fig1 and 12 . other forms of escutcheons clearly are acceptable to support the valve assembly shown herein . there are hot and cold water inlet conduits 20 and 22 and there is an outlet conduit 24 which will be connected to the hose 14 . the conduits 20 , 22 and 24 all extend into a valve body 26 which may contain a single lever valve control cartridge of the type sold by applicant , moen incorporated , under the trademark 1225 . this cartridge is located within a cylindrical portion 28 of the valve body 26 and will have an upwardly extending stem to which will be connected the cap assembly indicated at 30 and the lever 32 . manipulation of the lever 32 will control the volume and temperature of water supplied through the hose and thus discharged from the faucet wand . the escutcheon or ring 18 has a top surface 34 with a pair of limited arcuate slots 36 which slots will receive the downwardly extending arcuate projections 38 on the bottom of the bearing member 16 , illustrated in detail in fig9 and 10 and shown combined with the stand in fig7 . the bearing member 16 which is preferably formed of plastic to provide electrolytic isolation between the metallic ring or escutcheon 18 and the metallic valve body 26 provides support for rotation of the receptor 10 . member 16 has an upstanding vertical wall 42 which has a first portion 44 of a greater vertical height than a second portion 46 with the junction between the portions 44 and 46 forming vertical stops 48 which limit rotation of the receptor 10 . the member 16 has an outwardly extending circumferential or peripheral flange 50 which provides support for the bottom surface 52 of the receptor 10 . thus , the receptor 10 may rotate upon the bearing member and its interior surface 54 will contact the stops 48 to limit its rotation . in prior faucet assemblies of this type , rotation of the receptor was customarily limited to approximately 85 degrees . however , with the support assembly described herein , spout rotation has been expanded to approximately 145 degrees . this is clearly shown in fig9 . the bearing member 16 has an arcuate portion 56 , illustrated in fig9 and in section in fig8 which has a gradually curved surface 58 which curved surface will face the spout portion 12 of the receptor when the valve assembly is mounted on a sink deck . the hose 14 thus has a smooth non - metallic surface over which it will move when the wand is pulled out of the receptor . this is in contrast to prior art structures in which there was no such smooth non - metallic surface for movement of the hose which normally has a metallic outer sheath and thus there was both noise from hose movement and wear on the exterior of the hose . the present invention eliminates both the noise and the wear problem by the use of a non - metallic bearing member which has a curved surface over which the hose may move . the valve body 26 , which preferably is made of brass , is supported within the faucet assembly by a stand 60 illustrated in fig3 , 5 and 6 , and in assembled version with the bearing member , in fig7 . preferably the stand is formed of stainless steel . the stand must be inexpensive , but it must withstand the installation load of the faucet body without deforming and thus altering the specific orientation of the valve body . the stand must have sufficient clearance to allow the hose to move freely when the spout rotates and the material forming the stand should be similar to brass in terms of electromotive force to reduce the potential for corrosion due to electrolytic activity . the preferred material for the stand is thus stainless steel . the stand has a generally vertical wall 62 , the upper end of which has two inwardly extending tabs or projections 64 which will secure the valve body in position by bearing against a portion thereof as shown in fig1 . thus , the upper end of the stand securely holds the valve body in position . the stand has two vertical ribs indicated at 66 which not only increase the vertical strength of the stand but provide a shelf at their upper end surfaces 68 for support of the valve body . the valve body 26 is held by the tabs 64 and is seated upon the vertical ribs 66 . further , the vertical wall 62 of the stand has a pair of in turned projections 70 which will extend into an annular groove 72 on the exterior of the valve body . the valve body , when assembled , will be pushed down into the stand until the projections 70 snap into the groove 72 , thus permanently holding the valve body within the stand . the interengagement between the valve body and the stand includes the ribs 66 , the tabs 64 and the projections 70 , all combining to firmly hold the valve body in position within the stand . the lower portion of the stand will interlock with the bearing member 16 . as shown particularly in fig4 a rear portion of the stand has a generally horizontally extending projection 74 which is opposite a spout opening 76 in the stand , which opening is there to accommodate movement of the hose . the projection 74 will be received within a recess 78 in the bearing member 16 , as particularly shown in fig7 . this properly aligns the stand with the bearing member and the bearing member , as discussed above , is properly aligned with the escutcheon on the sink deck by the slots 36 and projections 38 . to further hold the stand within the bearing member , the lower portion of the stand has a pair of arcuately extending projections 80 , shown in fig5 which will extend within arcuate grooves 82 in the lower , downwardly facing portion , of the bearing member 16 . this interlocking arrangement is shown particularly in fig7 . the arcuate projections or extensions 80 and the mating grooves 82 on the stand and bearing member combined with the aligning projection 74 and the recess 78 all together serve to not only positively and firmly connect the stand with the bearing member , but also to align these two elements so that the entire faucet assembly will be properly located on the sink deck . as is common and required in faucets of this kind , there must be a vacuum breaker . in the present instance , at the upper portion of the valve body , there is a vacuum vent assembly 84 which includes a non - metallic hub 86 extending over the upper portion of the valve body adjacent to the location of the valve cartridge . the area inside of the hub 86 will form a chamber 88 which will receive water discharged from the valve cartridge through outlet port 90 . the hub 86 as shown in fig1 and 15 may have three downwardly extending ribs , two of which , indicated at 92 and 94 , are positioned closely adjacent to the vacuum breaker 98 to define a vacuum breaker chamber 96 . the ribs 92 and 94 isolate water discharged from the cartridge , which may contain contamination such as sediment , from the vacuum breaker . in prior art vacuum breakers , the seal element was exposed to direct water flow which allowed contamination to get under the seal surface . this is prevented in the present construction by the use of the ribs 92 and 94 . there is a third rib 100 which assists in locating the hub on the exterior surface of the valve body 26 . the hub is preferably formed of plastic and will be sealed at its upper and lower extremities by seal rings 102 and 104 which are formed on the cylindrical portion 28 of the valve body which encloses the cartridge . the ribs 92 , 94 and 100 each have a lower surface 93 which contacts a shelf 95 on the valve body 26 to locate the hub on the valve body . the vacuum breaker itself , indicated at 98 is elastomeric in form and has an umbrella portion 108 which masks a group of openings 110 in the wall of the hub 86 . there is a stem 112 which extends through a hole 114 in the hub with the stem having an enlargement 116 which serves to fix the vacuum breaker to the hub . in normal use , the umbrella portion 108 will close over the openings 110 so that no water is discharged from the hub . the outside of the hub will be at atmospheric pressure . in the event that there is a drop in line pressure supplying the faucet , and if at that time the wand were to be located in water within a sink , the negative pressure from the water supply could draw unclean water from the sink back through the faucet assembly into the water supply . however , this is prevented by the vacuum breaker assembly as if such a negative pressure were to occur , the atmospheric air outside of the hub would force its way inward , pushing the umbrella portion 108 away from the holes 110 and breaking the vacuum , preventing the backward flow of water from the sink through the faucet assembly into the potable water supply . the ribs 92 , 94 and 100 provide both isolation for the vacuum breaker openings and locator stops for the hub 86 . whereas the preferred form of the invention has been shown and described herein , it should be realized that there may be many modifications , substitutions and alterations thereto .']\n",
            "['US-2016230962-A1', 'Mechanical Engineering; Lightning; Heating; Weapons; Blasting', 'the invention discloses an optical assembly comprising a plurality of optical components that are concentric to one another , each optical component having a partially reflective and partially transmissive interface with an oblique angle of incidence , and the reflectivity of the interface increasing with distance from a common center ; a transitional optical component is provided between the light source and the first optical component in order to direct lights from a light source to the partially reflective and partially transmissive interface of the first optical component . by assembling the plurality of optical components , a much thinner lighting device can be achieved .', 'in the following description , the present invention is described with reference to a light box , but this by no means limits the scope of the invention ; for example , the present invention could be described with reference to a shopping window or other applications where it is needed . with reference to fig3 , the light box 10 comprises a front plate 12 and a back plate 14 , both defining a space for a lighting device 100 . the front plate is transparent ; a diffuser may be provided in front of the front plate to further optimize the uniformity . the back plate 14 may be transparent or provided with reflecting materials . when a transparent back plate is used , the light beam generated behind the back plate , such as natural light or ambient light , can penetrate the whole lighting device , including the front plate , and eventually can be seen by people standing in front of the front plate , which can fulfill an energy saving function during daytime if the light box needs to be turned off . as fig4 a - fig4 c show , the lighting device 100 comprises one light source 110 and an optical assembly 120 . the optical assembly 120 comprises a plurality of optical components ( 1220 , 1222 , 1224 , 1226 , 1228 ) that are concentric to one another , thereby sharing a common center where the light source is located ; each optical component has a partially reflective interface ( 1220 r , 1222 r , 1224 r , 1226 r ) with an oblique angle of incidence in relation to the light source 110 , and for the plurality of optical components the reflectivity of the partially reflective interface increases with distance from the common center . in this embodiment , the optical assembly 120 is hexagon - shaped . it has five optical components arranged parallel to each other . each optical component ( 1220 , 1222 , 1224 , 1226 , and 1228 ) actually is a hexagonal loop . a transitional optical component 1240 is provided below the led source 110 and surrounded by the 1 st optical component 1220 ; in this embodiment , the transitional optical component 1240 may be a cone - shaped reflector , which may exhibit total reflection , or which allows the majority of light from the light source to be reflected but a small part to pass through in the original light direction . thus , it can be understood that the light emitted from the led source 110 arrives first at the outer surface of the cone - shaped reflector 1240 . the slope angle of the outer surface of the cone is designed in such a manner that the reflected light coming from the cone can be incident substantially laterally on the reflecting interface of the 1 st optical component 1220 . in the embodiment shown by fig4 a - fig4 c , the oblique angle of incidence of each reflective interface in relation to the light source is set to 45 °, and the slope angle of the outer surface of the cone is 45 ° as well . it has to be noted that the substantially perpendicular configuration enables energy to be used maximally , without limiting other variations where the relative position of the transitional component and the 1 st optical component is provided with other angles . since each optical component is arranged obliquely in relation to the led source , the light emitted from the led source can be directed through the cone - shaped reflector 1240 to the reflecting interface ( 1220 r ) of the 1 st optical component 1220 . assuming there was a plane parallel to the front and back plate of the light box where the led source is located on , all optical components would be provided with their back toward the assumed plane ; therefore , the direction of the reflected light from the reflective interfaces eventually is substantially the same as that of the light emitted directly from the light source 110 . the reflecting interface ( 1220 r , 1222 r , 1224 r , 1226 r ) of each optical component is partially reflective and coated for different reflectivity , the reflectivity increasing with distance from the led source . as the table below shows , in this embodiment , the reflectivity of different optical component layers increases as the distance from the led source increases . the reflectivity of the 1 st optical component 1220 is set to 0 . 0857 , while that of the last one 1228 is 1 . 000 . the optical components with a relatively smaller reflectivity value generate less reflecting light from a same amount of incident light , but allow more light to pass through them and arrive at the next optical component . as regards the last component 1228 , all light received by it has to be reflected towards the front plate of the light box ; for example , its reflectivity value is set to 1 . 000 , which means no light needs to be transmitted through it . to obtain different light effects , the reflecting interface of each optical component may be coated with materials with specific transmitance or reflectivity at different wavelengths , so that different colors may be shown accordingly . fig5 shows the light path of the lighting device . in the embodiment of fig5 , a collimation lens can be provided to the led source , so that a collimated parallel light beam is obtained which is incident on the transitional optical component 1240 , here being the cone - shaped reflector . in practice , the transitional optical component 1240 can be in different variants so as to have various shapes , as long as all or most of the reflected light coming from it can be laterally directed to the 1 st optical component 1220 ; for example , a polygon prism or an irregular shape to fit different requirements . it is worth noting that the shape of the optical assembly 120 may be varied . the polygon may be a rectangle , an octagon , or other shape . the shape may also be a circle , as fig6 shows , or a circle - like shape . in the embodiment of fig6 , the optical components ( 1220 - 1228 ) are partially reflecting layers with an annular shape . accordingly , the light spot of the present embodiment exhibits a homogeneous circular light distribution . the transitional optical component 1240 is like a polygon prism . in accordance with the principle described above , the polygon prism is preferably provided in such a way that all or the majority of the reflected light issuing from the outer surface of the polygon prism travels substantially laterally to the reflecting interface of the 1 st optical component . the embodiment with a circular shape also covers other variations , such as ellipses or arcs . when a display area is more or less circular , the circular embodiment is more suitable ; for example , in a gallery or an artistic environment , the display frame is more often designed in a circular shape . another advantage of the present application is that the optical assembly is modulized ; therefore installation is quite easy . as fig7 shows , the optical modules with a rectangular shape are engaged with one another to form an array , and are arranged so as to fill the light box . the rectangular lighting device produces rectangular light spots accordingly . no matter how large the required area has to be , such as a big shop window , the modulized optical assemblys can always meet the requirements . the rectangular lighting device can make maximum use of the space because most areas for luminaires are rectangles . in the claims , the word “ comprising ” does not exclude other elements , and the indefinite article “ a ” or “ an ” does not exclude a plurality . the mere fact that certain measures are recited in mutually different dependent claims does not indicate that a combination of these measures cannot be used to advantage .']\n",

extraction between a full flow rate and a partial flow rate .', 'reference is now made to the drawings which show the preferred embodiments of the invention , and particularly to fig1 which is a schematic view of a welding system in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention . while the invention will be described herein with reference to gas shielded welding guns or torches , it is to be understood that this invention can also apply to mig and tig welding torches as well as to cutting torches . referring to fig1 , a welding torch 10 is shown in position above a workpiece 12 which is typically connected by means of a ground wire to a welding power supply ( not shown ). the welding torch 10 is typically supplied with wire 16 from a wire supply reel via a control system 17 . the control system not only regulates the rate at which welding wire 16 moves into the torch , but it can also regulate the flow of shielding gas from a gas source . the welding torch 10 includes a nozzle 14 having a fume extracting orifice connected to a passageway carried through a torch handle 18 and supply cable 20 to a vacuum pump 22 ( fig6 ). a switch 24 in the handle of the torch is also connected by wires running through the cable 20 to the control system 17 . referring now to fig6 , the switch 24 is used to control the amount of fumes and ambient air extraction between a full and a partial flow . the vacuum pump 22 , operated by a motor assembly 23 , draws the ambient air and fumes through the system . when the switch 24 is in the off position , as shown in fig6 , a valve assembly 25 , such as a solenoid valve , is positioned so that an opening 27 in the valve is aligned with opening 29 in tube or conduit 31 . opening 27 allows a full flow of fumes and ambient air through the system . if a reduced flow rate is desired , the switch is depressed to an on position , which moves the valve 25 to a lower position , aligning smaller opening 33 of the valve with opening 29 of tube 31 . opening 33 has a first end 35 and a second end 37 , wherein the first end has a larger diameter than the second end , which has a diameter approximately half of the diameter of the first end . thus , the flow rate is essentially reduced by half through the system . the handle 14 of the torch is of relatively small size , and since only a single cable 20 is used which carries all of the necessary cooling , control , power supply , and wire feeding conduits , a welding system is thereby provided which is convenient and easy to use and not unwieldy or cumbersome . referring now to fig2 which illustrates the preferred embodiment of the invention , the welding torch 10 includes an inner conduit 28 through which shielding gas and welding wire are supplied . this conduit may also carry electrical control wires to handle mounted switch 24 . the handle also carries a fume conduit 30 through which the fumes removed from the area of the weld are directed as they are drawn through the handle by the vacuum pump 22 . both the inner conduit 28 and the fume conduit 30 are surrounded by an outer casing 32 . the nozzle 14 , shown in detail in fig2 , includes a contact tip 34 having formed therein a passageway 36 through which welding wire 16 is directed into the weld . at an upper end 38 of the contact tip the passageway opens up so that it has substantially the same diameter as the passageway 39 in wire guide tube 40 . the contact tip 34 supplies substantially all of the electrical energy to the wire so that there will be practically no resistance heating of the welding wire 16 prior to its exiting the lower end of the contact tip . the contact tip is received into and extends through a tapered opening 44 formed in a tip holder 46 . the contact tip can also be tapered , and the outer surface of the contact tip and the opening 44 form an electrical contact so that electric current flowing through the inner conduit 28 will be carried to the welding wire . the tip holder 46 can include an internal thread which cooperates with an external thread on the wire guide tube 40 to cause the contact tip to firmly and positively engage the end of this tube . between the end of the wire tube and the contact tip is formed a manifold 48 into which shielding gas from passageway 43 may flow and then be directed through a plurality of passageways 42 into a chamber 50 where the shielding gas is then directed over the weld . the chamber 50 is formed between the contact tip 34 and an insulating cylinder 52 . outer shell 60 of the nozzle together with the outer cylindrical portion of the insulating cylinder 52 form a fume extracting passageway or chamber 62 into which the fumes generated by the weld may be drawn into the nozzle from the work surface in the direction shown by the arrows 64 . this fume passageway extends upwardly into a passageway 66 in the gun formed between the guide tube 40 and exhaust jacket or outer casing 32 . a plurality of orifices or openings 70 are formed between the lower end of the outer shell 60 and the cylinder 52 to extract ambient air and fumes from the work surface into the nozzle . the fume chamber 62 is connected to the fume conduit or passageway 66 by means of an opening 72 located near an upper end 73 of the nozzle . as may be seen in fig2 , the wire guide tube 40 and outer casing 32 bends downwardly in a goose - neck shaped configuration from the handle 18 . the opening 72 is located near this bend , and therefore the entrance to the fume conduit 66 is substantially axially aligned with the passageway 62 . this will result in a substantially equal pressure existing completely round the circumferential extent of the openings 70 and will allow fumes to be drawn into the nozzle evenly from any location around the nozzle . in the embodiment of the invention shown in fig2 , the size of the openings 70 , the passageways 62 and 66 , and the fume conduit 30 are so designed that , in combination with the capacity of the vacuum pump 22 , sufficient ambient air is drawn into and mixed with the hot fumes removed from the welding area that the torch handle 14 is maintained at a temperature below that which would cause rapid deterioration of the gun materials or discomfort to the operator . also , the openings 70 are so located axially on the nozzle that the fumes must travel upwardly and away from the weld and are therefore cooled somewhat prior to entering the openings 70 . this combination therefore allows a welding gun to be constructed of a size which is convenient to use , since only one cable is attached thereto , and which provides for the efficient removal of smoke and fumes from the area of the weld . as seen in fig3 and 5 , in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention , a plurality of spaced apart openings or orifices 70 are formed along the circumference of an annular ring 80 formed on outer shell 60 . the ring 80 is formed by a portion of the nozzle which has a larger diameter and has rounded edges as compared to the diameter of the remaining portion 81 of the nozzle . the openings are shown to be circular ; however , other shapes could be used without departing from the scope of the invention . the openings are shown to be equally spaced apart ; however , other configurations could be used without departing from the scope of the present invention . referring to fig2 , the openings or apertures 70 are configured such that the ambient air is mixed with fumes from the welding procedure to be drawn into the fume chamber in a direction substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis 83 of the welding torch as shown by arrows 64 . by orienting the openings this way , the air is drawn directly into the torch , thus increasing the efficiency with which the ambient air is used to cool the extracted fumes and the handle . the plurality of openings are shown to be closely spaced together to increase the amount of air and fumes that are extracted from the work area into the welding torch and fume gun . referring now to fig4 , the nozzle portion has a plurality of tabs 84 formed on an inner diameter 85 of nozzle portion 81 for interlocking the nozzle section onto mating slots 86 an end of the welding torch conduit or passageway 66 . the nozzle tabs engage the slots and the nozzle can be rotated to easily lock and unlock the nozzle onto the end of casing 32 . the exemplary embodiment has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments . obviously , modifications and alterations will occur to others upon reading and understanding the preceding detailed description . it is intended that the exemplary embodiment be construed as including all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof .']\n",

accompanying figures . like elements in the various figures are denoted by like reference numerals for consistency . in the following detailed description of embodiments of the invention , numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the invention . however , it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details . in other instances , well - known features have not been described in detail to avoid obscuring the invention . in general , embodiments of the invention provide a method and apparatus to provide low - latency , high - bandwidth , fault - tolerant , highly scalable event driven simulation services . further , embodiments of the invention , provide a platform to support multiplayer games , where the multiplayer games are event driven simulations . further , embodiments of the invention provide a method and apparatus to allow a developer to create simulation programs ( e . g ., multiplayer games , etc .) without requiring the simulation developer to have any knowledge about multi - threading , transactional databases , or an in - depth knowledge about scalable systems . fig1 shows a system in accordance with one embodiment of the invention . as shown in fig1 , the system includes a communication layer ( 102 ), a simulation logic layer ( 104 ) and an object store layer ( 106 ). each of the aforementioned layers is described below . as shown in fig1 , the communication layer ( 102 ) provides an interface for the users ( 100 ) to interact with the system . the communication layer ( 100 ), in turn , is operatively connected to the simulation logic layer ( 104 ). further , the simulation logic layer ( 104 ) is operatively connected to the object store layer ( 106 ). as discussed above , the communication layer ( 102 ) provides an interface to between the users ( 100 ) and the system . more specifically , in one embodiment of the invention , the communication layer ( 102 ) includes functionality to receive data from various devices ( e . g ., cell phones , personal digital assistants ( pdas ), desktops , laptops , etc .) in various communication protocols . the communication layer ( 102 ) also includes functionality to convert the data into a format that may be used by the system . in accordance to one embodiment of the invention , the simulation logic ( 104 ) layer includes functionality to receive data from the communication layer ( 102 ). the simulation logic layer ( 104 ) includes also functionality to process the received data ( discussed below ). in one embodiment of the invention , the simulation logic layer ( 104 ) processes the data using a stateless task processor ( i . e . a processor which treats each task as an independent transaction ). in order to process the received data , the simulation logic layer ( 104 ) interacts with the object store layer ( 106 ). in one embodiment of the invention , the object store layer ( 106 ) includes one or more objects , typically , serializable objects ( sos ), as well as functionality to manage the objects ( e . g ., functionality to send copies of the objects to the simulation logic layer ( 104 ), functionality to update the content of the objects , track which objects are currently being used , etc .). in one embodiment of the invention , each object includes data and / or a method for acting on the data within the object or other object . returning to the discussion of fig1 , the simulation logic layer ( 104 ) typically requests the object store layer ( 106 ) to provide various objects . in response to the request , the object store layer ( 106 ) sends the requested objects ( or copies of the requested objects ) to the simulation logic layer ( 104 ). a method for request and receiving an object ( e . g ., an object ) is described below in fig4 - 6 . in one embodiment of the invention , the object store layer ( 106 ) also includes functionality to track of the state for each simulation executing in the system . for example , if the system is executing a multiplayer game ( i . e ., the simulation executing on the system is an event driven simulation ), then the object store layer ( 106 ) may store , in addition to storing objects for the multiplayer game , the player states and information about the players . in one or more embodiments of the invention , the object store layer ( 106 ) may be implemented as a transactional distributed database . those skilled in the art appreciate that the object store layer ( 106 ) may be implemented using other types of storage systems , e . g ., a flat - file , a hierarchical , network , object - oriented or object - relational database , etc . fig2 shows a system in accordance with one embodiment of the invention . as shown in fig2 , the system may be divided into a series of stacks ( 150 , 152 ) where each stack includes a communication layer component ( 154 , 156 ), a simulation logic layer component ( 158 , 160 ), and an object store layer component ( 106 ). each of the aforementioned components includes the functionality of the layer to which they belong . for example , each communication layer component ( 154 , 156 ) includes the functionality to the communication layer ( 102 ) described as fig1 . continuing with the discussion of fig2 , the communication layer component ( 154 , 156 ) within a given stack ( 150 , 152 ) may communicate with other communication layers in other stacks ( 150 , 152 ). this functionality allows users connected to different stacks ( 150 , 152 ) to communicate with each other . further , in one embodiment of the invention , the individual communication layers component ( 154 , 156 ) within the stacks ( 150 , 152 ) may communicate with each other in order to provide load balancing across the various stacks ( 150 , 152 ) executing in the system . for example , in one embodiment of the invention , stacks ( 150 , 152 ) ( via their respective communication layer components ( 154 , 156 )) may send periodic load updates ( e . g ., information about the current load on the stack ( 150 , 152 )) to each other . the aforementioned information may be used to transfer users from heavily loaded stacks to a lightly loaded stack . this allows for the system to load balance across all stacks in the system . as shown in fig2 , the communication layer component ( 154 , 156 ) in the stack ( 150 , 152 ) is operatively connected to a simulation logic layer component ( 158 , 160 ) associated with the stack ( 150 , 152 ). unlike the communication layer ( 154 , 156 ) in the stack ( 150 , 152 ), the simulation logic layer component ( 158 , 160 ) in the stack ( 150 , 152 ) is not connected to simulation logic layer components ( 158 , 160 ) in the other stacks ( 150 , 152 ). rather , the simulation logic layer component ( 158 , 160 ) in each stack ( 150 , 152 ) is only operatively connected to the communication layer component ( 154 , 156 ) and the object store layer component ( 106 ) of the stack ( 150 , 152 ) in which the simulation logic layer component ( 158 , 160 ) resides . in one embodiment of the invention , the object store layer ( 106 ) within a stack ( 150 , 152 ) corresponds to a cache ( 162 , 164 ). further , the cache ( 162 , 164 ) in each stack ( 150 , 152 ) may communicate with other caches ( 162 , 164 ) in other stacks ( 150 , 152 ) as well as communicate with a master object store ( 166 ). in one embodiment of the invention , the cache ( 162 , 164 ) within a given stack ( 150 , 152 ) stores the most recently requested and / or accessed objects from the master object store ( 166 ). in one embodiment of the invention , the system may include a master object store backup ( 168 ). the purpose of the master object store backup ( 168 ) is to replicate / mirror the content of the master object store ( 166 ) such that the master object store backup ( 168 ) may take the place of the master object store ( 166 ) in the event that the master object store ( 166 ) fails . for example , if data is corrupted in the master object store ( 166 ), then the data may be found in the master object store backup ( 168 ). in one embodiment of the invention , each stack ( 150 , 152 ) in the system may be associated with its own processor ( or processors ) and its own memory space . alternatively , a single processor may be associated with one or more stacks . fig3 shows a system in accordance with one embodiment of the invention . more specifically , the fig3 shows a detailed view of one stack within a system in accordance with one embodiment of the invention . specifically , as described above , a stack may include a communication layer component ( 154 ), simulation logic layer component ( 158 ), and an object store layer component ( represented in as a cache ( 162 )). further , as described above , the stack may be operatively connected to a master object store ( 166 ). in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , the communication layer component ( 154 ) may include an event listener ( not shown ). the event listener may be assigned to a user after a user logs onto the system . the event listener includes functionality to receive data from a user ( not shown ). those skilled in the art will appreciate that an event may be in the form of any input ( e . g ., movement of joystick , stroke of key on keyboard , movement in virtual reality zone , or any user action that generates an input into a device ) or lack thereof ( e . g ., an event generated by lack of input from timing ), generated by the user . as discussed above , the communication layer component ( 154 ) includes functionality to reformat the data received from the user , if required , and functionality to send the data to the simulation logic layer component ( 158 ). the communication layer component ( 154 ) may also include functionality to create a task based on the event from the user . after creating a task , the communication layer component ( 154 ) may send the task to the simulation logic layer ( 158 ). those skilled in the art will appreciate that the user may send a task ( as opposed to an event ) to the system . continuing with the discussion of fig3 , the simulation logic layer ( 158 ) includes an execution engine ( 200 ) with a task queue ( 202 ). the task and / or data sent from the communication layer component ( 154 ), as described above , may be used to populate the task queue ( 202 ). those skilled in the art will appreciate that if data ( typically defining an event ) is received from the user , then the data is used to create a task . once created , the task queued on the task queue ( 202 ). in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , the task queue ( 202 ) may include the tasks from one or more users . those skilled in the art will appreciate that the queue may use any protocol ( e . g ., first - in - first - out , last - in - first - out , a priority based , etc .) to track tasks within the task queue ( 202 ) and to determine the order in which to execute the tasks . in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , a task is executed using the execution engine ( 200 ). the execution engine ( 200 ) may include functionality to execute the task by assigning an execution thread for the task and executing the execution thread . those skilled in the art will appreciate that assigning an execution thread to a task allows the task to execute independent of other tasks . thus , the other tasks may be simultaneously executed by the execution engine ( 200 ). in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , as a result of executing the task , an initial object ( 204 ) may be retrieved from : ( i ) the cache ( 162 ) in the stack in which the execution engine ( 200 ) resides , ( ii ) the cache in another stack ( e . g ., 164 in fig2 ), or ( iii ) the master object store ( 166 ). the execution of the task may also require one or more dependent objects ( 206 , 208 ) to be retrieved . in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , the dependent objects ( 206 , 208 ) may be obtained in the same manner as the initial object ( 204 ). when the execution thread is finished executing , then the execution engine ( 200 ) may include functionality to return the objects , both the initial object ( 204 ) and dependent objects ( 206 , 208 ) ( if any exist ), to the object store layer ( 106 in fig2 ), thereby committing the transaction . fig4 shows a method in accordance with one embodiment of the invention . initially , a user connects to the communication layer ( st 401 ). in one embodiment of the invention , the user may connect to the communication layer by typing a uniform resource locator ( url ) associated with the system , executing a program which allows for automatic connection to the communication layer , etc . the user is subsequently connected to a particular stack ( st 402 ). in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , the user is automatically routed to a stack with a minimal number of users in order to maintain load - balancing . although not shown is fig4 , as part of being connected to a particular stack ( st 402 ), the user may be authenticated to the stack . alternatively , the user may be authenticated when the user connects to the system ( i . e ., prior to being connected to a particular stack within the system ). continuing with fig4 , once a user is connected to a stack , the stack may register an event listener for the user ( st 403 ). the event listener may be used to notify the system when the user generates an event . the notification may include , for example , triggering an interrupt in the communication layer . when the user generates an event ( st 404 ), a task corresponding to the event is subsequently queued on the task queue ( st 405 ). when it is time for the task to be executed ( i . e ., when the task has the highest priority to be executed ), the task is removed from the task queue and an initial object , based on the task , is requested ( st 406 ). in response to the request , a determination is then made as to whether the initial object is in the cache of the stack local to the user . if the initial object is in the cache of the stack local to the user , then the initial object is obtained from the cache of the stack local to the user and loaded into the stack &# 39 ; s simulation logic layer ( st 410 ). the object may be obtained , for example , using a get command or a peek command . in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , the get command locks the object , thereby preventing access to the object to other tasks . alternatively , locking the object may only prevent access to the object by tasks which request an object using a get command . in one embodiment of the invention , a peek command does not lock the object ; rather , the peek command creates a task - local copy of the object using the object &# 39 ; s last saved value and the object is not updated in the cache , master object store , or master backup object store using after the task is completed . further , in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , if the initial object is locked by another task , then the current task waits until the other task has released the lock in order to obtain the object using a get command . continuing with fig4 , if the initial object is not in the cache of the stack local to the user , then a determination is made as to whether the initial object is in another cache associated with another stack ( st 408 ). if the object is in another cache associated with another stack , then the object is loaded in the simulation logic layer of the stack associated with the user ( st 410 ). if , however , the object is determined not to be in another stack , then the object may be obtained from the master object store ( st 409 ) before being loaded in the stack &# 39 ; s simulation logic layer ( st 410 ). after the initial object is loaded into the stack &# 39 ; s simulation logic layer , in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , a transactional context and a thread are assigned to the task ( st 411 ). the transactional context may be used , for example , to uniquely identify a transaction in the system . in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , the transactional context may include a timestamp portion and a random number portion . the timestamp portion may be determined according to the task ( e . g ., created when the task is placed in the task queue ( st 405 ), when the initial object is loaded ( st 410 ), when the transactional context is assigned ( st 411 ), etc .). in st 412 , the thread initiates execution of the task ( i . e ., the thread executes the initial method associated with the initial object on the initial object ). those skilled in the art will appreciate that the initial method is usually present in the initial object . as described above , executing the task may require obtaining and executing one or more dependent objects . fig5 shows a method for obtaining and executing one or more dependent objects and completing the execution of a task in accordance with one embodiment of the invention . initially , a determination is made as to whether a dependent object is requested within the task ( st 451 ). if a dependent object is not requested , then the initial object returns from the initial method call ( st 457 ) and the transaction is committed ( st 458 ). in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , a transaction is committed when any modifications to the initial object become permanent . once the transaction has committed , the initial object is returned to the object store ( st 459 ). returning an object to the object store may include , for example , releasing any locks associated with the object , etc . continuing with fig5 , if in st 451 it is determined that a dependent object is requested within the task , then a determination is made as to whether the dependent object is in the cache of the stack local to the user ( st 452 ). if the dependent object is in the cache of the stack local to the user , then the dependent object is obtained from the cache of the stack local to the user and loaded into the stack &# 39 ; s simulation logic layer ( st 455 ). alternatively , the dependent object may not be in the cache of the stack local to the user , in which case , in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , a determination is made as to whether the dependent object is in another cache associated with another stack ( st 453 ). if the dependent object is in another cache associated with another stack , then the dependent object is loaded in the simulation logic layer of the stack associated with the user ( st 455 ). if , however , the dependent object is determined not to be in another stack , then the dependent object may be obtained from the master object store ( st 454 ) and loaded in the stack simulation logic layer ( st 455 ). continuing with fig5 , once the dependent object is loaded , the initial method or another method is executed using the dependent object ( st 456 ). the other method may include , for example , a method associated with a dependent object or a method not associated with any object . further , executing an initial or other method on the dependent object may result in a request for another dependent object . in st 451 , a determination is made if another dependent object is requested within the task . if another dependent method is required within the task , then the process repeats starting with st 452 . alternatively , another dependent object might not be requested from within the task . in which case , the execution using the dependent object is completed and the initial object returns from the initial method call ( st 457 ). next , the transaction commits ( st 458 ). after the transaction commits , all objects are returned to the object store ( as described above ) ( st 459 ). in order to load a dependent object from the object store ( as described in st 455 of fig5 ), in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , the task may first obtain a lock for the object . this may be performed , for example , when the task uses a get command in order to obtain the object . those skilled in the art will recognize the potential for deadlocks that may result when more than one task accesses more than one object . fig6 shows a method for preventing deadlocks in accordance with one embodiment of the invention . initially , a determination is made as to whether a flag is set for the task ( st 601 ). a flag may be set for a task , for example , when a task with more priority ( e . g ., a task with a timestamp value older than the current task , the task is more critical than the current task , etc .) requests access to an object locked by the current task . if a flag is set for the task , then the transaction aborts ( st 602 ). in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , aborting a transaction may include returning the state of all objects modified by the task to the state of the object before the object was accessed by the task . after the states have been changed , the locks on the objects held by the task are released and the task surrenders all threads and the transaction . next , the task is re - queued ( st 603 ). in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , the task queue queues tasks according to timestamp values associated with the task . thus , if the newer tasks are always flagged and re - queued while the older tasks execute , then starvation may be successfully avoided . this allows for fairness in the system in which all tasks may execute . continuing with fig6 , in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , if a determination is made that the interrupt flag is not set for the task ( st 604 ), then a determination is made as to whether the dependent object that the task requested is locked ( st 604 ). if the dependent object is not locked , then the task passes to st 606 , and obtains the lock on the dependent object ( not shown ). in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , after the task obtains the lock on the dependent object , the timestamp of the task is associated with the dependent object . alternatively , if a determination is made that the dependent object is locked in st 604 , then a determination is made in st 605 as to whether the timestamp associated with the dependent object is greater than the timestamp associated with the task . if the timestamp associated with the dependent object is greater than the timestamp associated with the task , then the object waits to obtain the lock on the dependent object ( st 606 ). this allows for the older task to complete execution . in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , when the task waits , the thread of the task is put to sleep . thus , the thread may not execute until an interrupt is set for the thread of the task , such as when the dependent object is released . when the lock is released , in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , the waiting task obtains the lock on the dependent object ( not shown ). next , the timestamp of the task may be associated with the dependent object . those skilled in the art will appreciate that while the above deadlock detection has been described with respect to timestamps , other priority implementations may also be used . for example , in st 605 , a determination may be made as to whether the task having the lock of the dependent object has greater priority than the current task . if the task having the lock of the dependent object has greater priority than the current task , then the current task may wait until the lock is released . continuing with st 605 of fig6 , if the timestamp of the dependent object is not greater than the timestamp associated with the task , then the task is older than the task holding the lock for the dependent object . thus , an interrupt is set for the task holding the lock of the dependent object ( st 607 ). in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , the current task waits to obtain the lock on the dependent object ( st 606 ). the current task may obtain the lock , for example , after the task holding the lock has completed aborting the transaction ( as described in st 602 ). once the current task has obtained the lock of the dependent object , the timestamp of the task may be associated with the dependent object . in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , a presence of a deadlock condition is checked every time a timestamp is updated . this helps prevent massive long - term failure in the system . in accordance with one embodiment of the invention , a tracking mechanism may be used to track the number of potential deadlocks in the system . a potential deadlock may occur , for example , if a transaction must abort . if a large number of potential deadlocks exist , then the tracking mechanism may issue an alert . this allows for a system administrator to keep track of the state of the system . the invention may be implemented on virtually any type of computer regardless of the platform being used . for example , as shown in fig7 , a computer system ( 300 ) includes a processor ( 302 ), associated memory ( 304 ), a storage device ( 306 ), and numerous other elements and functionalities typical of today &# 39 ; s computers ( not shown ). the computer ( 300 ) may also include input means , such as a keyboard ( 308 ) and a mouse ( 310 ), and output means , such as a monitor ( 312 ). the computer system ( 300 ) is connected to a local area network ( lan ) or a wide area network ( e . g ., the internet ) ( not shown ) via a network interface connection ( not shown ). those skilled in the art will appreciate that these input and output means may take other forms . further , those skilled in the art will appreciate that one or more elements of the aforementioned computer system ( 300 ) may be located at a remote location and connected to the other elements over a network . further , the invention may be implemented on a distributed system having a plurality of nodes , where each portion of the invention ( e . g ., object store layer , communication layer , simulation logic layer , etc .) may be located on a different node within the distributed system . in one embodiment of the invention , the node corresponds to a computer system . alternatively , the node may correspond to a processor with associated physical memory . further , software instructions to perform embodiments of the invention may be stored on a computer readable medium such as a compact disc ( cd ), a diskette , a tape , a file , or any other computer readable storage device . while the invention has been described with respect to a limited number of embodiments , those skilled in the art , having benefit of this disclosure , will appreciate that other embodiments can be devised which do not depart from the scope of the invention as disclosed herein . accordingly , the scope of the invention should be limited

processing components . the base 12 optionally includes a port 13 for communication with a driving force , such as a source of vacuum , preferably a vacuum pump . alternatively , the port 13 maybe located in a wall of the collar as shown in fig1 . the base 12 also includes a bottom 12 a and one or more sidewalls upstanding therefrom . in the rectangular embodiment shown , there are four connecting sidewalls , namely , opposite sidewalls 12 b and 12 c , and opposite sidewalls 12 d and 12 e . the base includes an outer peripheral flange 4 that in combination with an inner peripheral portion of the sidewalls forms a peripheral groove 6 ( fig8 ) that receives gasket 5 . preferably the gasket 5 has a lower peripheral portion 5 a that seats in the groove 6 and a top peripheral portion 5 b that extends above the groove 6 . the upper portion 5 b is skewed outwardly so that when the lower portion 5 a of the gasket is in place in the groove 6 , the upper portion 5 b it is aligned or substantially aligned with the outer surface of the side walls 12 b , 12 c , 12 d and 12 e . the gasket 5 thus creates a seal between the base 12 and the component in contact with the gasket 5 , such as the collar 14 , as discussed in greater detail below . optionally , and as shown in fig1 , one can have of one or more alignment tabs 17 that arise up from the base , preferably at one or more of the intersections of the adjacent sidewalls . the one or more tabs 17 are used to help position the sample processing units ( filter plates , maldi target supports , collection plates , spacers and / or inserts , described below in more detail ) into the base 12 and to align the collar 14 to the base 12 . other configurations are within the scope of the invention , provided a seal is created . in the embodiment shown , collar 14 also has four lateral walls , namely , opposite walls 14 b , 14 c and opposite walls 14 d , 14 e . the lateral walls must extend downwardly ( and / or the side walls of the base 12 must extend upwardly ) a distance sufficient to accommodate the components that are positioned between the collar 14 and the base 12 . the vertical length of these lateral walls ( and / or the side walls ) thus can vary depending upon the application . a skirt 15 preferably is formed along the bottom periphery of the lateral walls such that the skirt 15 positions over the peripheral portion 4 of the base 12 in sealing relationship when in the assembled condition , as seen in fig2 . a gasket 75 is attached to the inner , top surface of the collar 14 around the top opening and is designed to seal against the top surface of a component disposed against the collar , as discussed in greater detail below . the gasket 75 preferably includes a peripheral slot 77 that mates with a corresponding inner peripheral rib 79 in the collar 14 , shown in fig7 . a plurality of rectangular steps 74 may also be provided in the gasket 75 , shown in fig2 , to mate with support insert 37 shown in fig5 . it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to any particular sealing means . for example , instead of separate gaskets that seal the collar and the base , a single unitary gasket 55 or flexible unitary gasket 55 ′ could be used , such as is shown in fig9 and 10 . it also will be understood by those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to any particular sample processing device ; devices that enable filtration , collection , digestion of protein by enzymes , wash steps , solvent elution , maldi tof , sequencing , pcr clean - up , cell growth , cell lysis , dna or rna capture , assaying , etc . can be used in the present invention . those skilled in the art will understand that the port for the driving force such as a vacuum port could be in the base 12 as in fig1 or the collar 14 as in fig1 . when the vacuum is used in the collar 14 , a separate and distinct base becomes an optional , although preferred element of the invention . as shown in fig1 , with the port 13 in the collar 14 one may if so desired use any relatively flat surface such as a bench top , the floor or a wall as the base 12 and the seal is formed by the collar and the first seal between the collar and base ( the surface against which it is placed ). the present invention can be used with a variety of plates and other components that are generally used in such plate systems . these include but are not limited to microporous filter plates , ultrafiltration filter plates , chromatographic plates ( either containing chromatography media or having a monolithic structure containing such media cast in place in a portion of the plate ), cell harvester plates , cell growth plates such as caco 2 cell growth plates , cell lysis plates , dna or rna or plasmid capture plates , collections plates with single or multiple wells , maldi target trays and / or maldi targets and the like . a single plate may be used with the present manifold if desired , either within the collar or on top of the collar ( as explained in more detail below ). generally , two or more plates can be used together by stacking them in the proper arrangement such as a microporous filter plate on top of a ultrafilter filtration plate that is on top of collection plate , a microporous filter plate on top of a collection plate , a ultrafilter filtration plate on top of collection plate , a filter plate on top of a chromatographic plate or a dna or rna or plasmid capture plate , or the like . additionally , spacers may be placed between the plates or under the plate ( s ) if desired or required for a particular application . likewise , flow director plates , separate underdrain plates or spout plates between adjacent plates or wicks such as are shown in our co - pending application u . s . ser . no . 09 / 565 , 963 , filed may 20 , 2000 , may also be used in the present invention to direct the flow of fluid in a particular manner . a variety of adaptor plates , half or quarter plates with different configurations and / or characteristics may also be used in the present invention . depending upon the application , generally the sample processing components are molded parts and are solvent compatible . the sample processing devices include single well and multiwell devices . metals , polyolefins and filled nylon are suitable materials of construction . rarely used components can be machined . in the embodiment shown in fig1 and 7 , the sample processing devices positioned between the base 12 and collar 14 are a filter plate 20 and a collection plate 22 , both preferably being made of polyethylene , and thus the length of the lateral walls of collar 14 ( and / or the side walls of the base 12 ) is made sufficient to accommodate these components when assembled to the base 12 . in the embodiment shown in fig1 , the sample processing devices positioned between the base 12 and collar 14 are filter plates 20 and 20 a and a collection plate 22 . the filter plates 20 and 20 a , and the collection plate 22 are configured for proper stacking and alignment as is known in the art . the filter plates 20 and 20 a includes a plurality of wells 21 and 21 a , preferably arranged in an ordered two - dimensional array . although a 96 - well plate array is illustrated , those skilled in the art will appreciate that the number of wells is not limited to 96 ; standard formats with 384 or fewer or more wells are within the scope of the present invention . the wells are preferably cylindrical with fluid - impermeable walls , and have a width and depth according to the desired use and amount of contents to be sampled . the wells are preferably interconnected and arranged in a uniform array , with uniform depths so that the tops and bottoms of the wells are planar or substantially planar . preferably the array of wells comprises parallel rows of wells and parallel columns of wells , such that each well not situated on the outer perimeter of the plate is surrounded by eight other wells . preferably the plates 20 and 20 a are generally rectangular , and as shown in fig7 and 8 , plate 20 is stacked on top of a collection plate 22 . alternatively , as shown in fig1 , plate 20 a is stacked on top of a plate 20 , which is stacked on top of collection plate 22 . the filter plates 20 and 20 a can be of a conventional design . each of the wells 21 of the filter plate 20 includes a membrane or porous structure ( not shown ) sealed to or positioned in the well . the sealing can be accomplished by any suitable means , including heat - sealing , sealing with ultrasonics , solvents , adhesives , by diffusion bonding , compression such as by a ring or skive , etc . the type of membrane suitable is not particularly limited , and by way of example can include nitrocellulose , cellulose acetate , polycarbonate , polypropylene and pvdf microporous membranes , or ultrafiltration membranes such as those made from polysulfone , pvdf , cellulose or the like . additionally , materials also include glass fibers , glass mats , glass cloths , depth filters , nonwovens , woven meshes and the like or combinations there of , depending upon the application , or the membrane can be cast - in - place as disclosed in u . s . pat . nos . 6 , 048 , 457 and 6 , 200 , 474 , the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference . a single membrane covering all of the wells could be used , or each well can contain or be associated with its own membrane that can be the same or different from the membrane associated with one or more of the other wells . each such membrane support is preferably coextensive with the bottom of its respective well . each of the wells 21 of the filter plate 20 also includes an outlet , preferably in the form of a spout that is centrally located with respect to each well 21 and preferably does not extend below the plate skirt . the collection plate 22 preferably is also generally rectangular , and includes a plurality of openings 23 . each opening 23 corresponds to a well 21 of the filtration plate , such that when in the assembled condition , each well 21 of the filter plate 20 is registered with and thus in fluid communication with a respective opening 23 of the collection plate 22 . each opening 23 terminates in a bottom 25 , which is preferably closed unless it is an intermediate plate with a collection plate below it or the manifold itself acts as a sump or collection plate where optionally a spacer , such as is shown in fig3 and discussed below , may be used . the collection plate 22 can be of a conventional design . the filter plate 20 has a lower peripheral skirt 27 that allows it to be stacked over the collection plate 22 . when the filter plate 20 is stacked over the collection plate 22 as in the fig1 embodiment , proper alignment is ensured , such that each of the spouts is positioned directly over and in close proximity to a respective opening 23 in the collection plate 22 . the proximity and alignment of each spout with a respective opening prevents cross - talk among neighboring wells . the stacked plates are positioned inside the base 12 as an integral unit . the collar 14 is positioned over the two plates and sits against the base flange gasket 5 , which seals the base 12 to the collar 14 . this also positions the collar gasket 75 on the top perimeter edge of the filter plate 20 . when vacuum is applied to the manifold , the collar 14 is the only moving component . as additional vacuum is applied , the vacuum causes the collar 14 to compress both gaskets . however , the filter plate 20 and collection plate 21 remain fixed in the loaded position because they make up a solid stack assembly that includes the base 12 , the collection plate 21 and the filter plate 20 that is independent of and not influenced by the relative movement of the collar 14 . thus , the stack height of the filter plate and collection plate remains constant . a liquid handler can be programmed to dispense onto the membrane in the filter plate 20 , regardless of whether the assembly is under vacuum , since the stack height is not changed by the application of vacuum . the assembly , therefore , is readily adaptable to automation protocols and allows for quantitative filtrate transfer . similarly , when using an alternative embodiment of one seal such as shown in fig9 and 10 a similar sealing action occurs wherein the collar 14 moves to compress the gasket . the height of the plate ( s ) remains the same with or without the application of the vacuum . since the manifold design of the present invention is modular , different components can be positioned between the base and the collar ( as mentioned above ), allowing a variety of applications to be performed . in one embodiment , ( fig3 ) where the application requires a filter plate 20 , but does not require a collection plate 22 , a spacer or removable support 80 can replace the collection plate thereby maintaining the unit stack height ( fig3 ). the spacer or removable support 80 positions the filter plate 20 in the proper x - and y - axis orientation so that robotics can deliver sample to the wells 21 of the filter plate 20 . it also positions the filter plate 20 at the proper stack height so that the collar 14 can seal to the base 12 and plate 20 simultaneously upon the application of vacuum . accordingly , preferably the spacer or support 80 is dimensioned similar to the collection plate 20 , as shown . in the embodiment shown , the spacer or support 80 includes a central beam 81 ( positioned so as to not interfere with the operation of the filter plate ) to help support the filter plate 20 . the top seal gasket 75 on the collar 14 can be used to create a seal when it is desired to carry out a quick wash procedure by placing the filter plate on top of the collar 14 rather than inside the manifold assembly . indeed , this gasket can accept a variety of support structures for use with unique applications , such as a multiscreen ® underdrain support grid commercially available from millipore corporation . fig7 and 8 illustrate one embodiment of a bottom gasket 5 ′. in this embodiment , the gasket 5 ′ is positioned in the groove 6 in base 12 as best seen in fig8 . it includes a wiper portion 51 that extends above the groove 6 and into recess 6 ′ formed in skirt 15 of the collar 14 as shown . the height of the wiper portion 51 and its position in the recess 6 ′ allows for some variability in the positioning of the collar 14 and base 12 ( and thus variability in the stack height of the components contained between the collar and base ) without sacrificing the integrity of the seal . fig4 a and 4b illustrate a further embodiment of the manifold of the present invention . this embodiment is useful for the direct transferring of eluant from filter plate 20 to one or more maldi targets . specifically , sample preparation prior to analysis by maldi - tof mass spectrometry often involves desalting and concentration of samples ( e . g ., peptides ). simultaneous preparation and analysis of multiple samples is often desirable , and can be carried out using the manifold assembly of the present invention . accordingly , instead of the collection plate 21 of the embodiment of fig1 , or the support tray of the embodiment of fig3 , a target tray 40 is used . the design of the target tray 40 is not particular limited , and will depend upon the configuration of the target ( s ) chosen . the tray 40 can hold one or more targets . for example , in the fig4 a embodiment , four maldi targets 41 commercially available from applera corporation are used . alternatively , as shown in fig4 b , a single target 41 ′ such as a maldi target commercially available from bruker daltonics can be used . the target tray 40 is positioned under the spouts of each well in the filter plate 20 , with the correct stack height enabling the collar 14 to seal against the base 12 as before . as in the embodiments of fig1 and 3 , the application of vacuum ( e . g ., the transition from atmospheric pressure to a different pressure ) does not result in any z - axis movement of the operative component , which in this case is the filter plate stacked on top of the maldi target ( s ). in each of these embodiments , the stack height is critical to the sealing of the assembly . if a deep well filter plate were used , for example , a taller collar 14 and / or base 12 , or an extension with appropriately located additional sealing gaskets , can be used , to insure the seal between the top of the plate and the flange on the base 12 . fig1 shows the use of a deep well filter plate 20 b with a regular depth collection plate 22 in which the plate is designed to fit within the opening of the collar 14 so that a longer collar and / or base is not needed . fig1 shows a system using a deep well filter plate 20 b and a deep well collection plate 22 b . in this embodiment , the collar 14 b has been made taller to provide the exact height requirement for the desired plates used . the components of the stacked unit ( e . g ., the filter plate 20 and collection plate 22 , or the filter plate 20 , target 41 and target tray 40 ) do not move independently of one another , since they are positioned in stacked relationship on the base 12 and any movement is limited to the collar 14 . as a result , their relative position remains constant regardless of whether the assembly is under vacuum , thereby allowing a liquid handler to be programmed to dispense to the unit , for example . fig5 and 6 illustrate the versatility of the manifold assembly of the present invention . in this embodiment , the collar 14 is place in sealing relationship with base 12 , and a sample preparation device such as a multiwell plate 20 is placed on the top surface of the collar 14 . an optional grid 37 can be positioned under the plate 20 to assist in supporting the plate 20 . the plate 20 seals against the top gasket positioned in the collar 14 . accordingly , vacuum can be used as the driving force to filter sample through the plate 20 . this enables a quick wash procedure without having to place the filter plate inside the manifold . the top gasket can accept a wide variety of support structures for use with unique applications , such as a 384 seq plate rib structure for drop removal and a multiscreen ® underdrain support grid , both commercially available from millipore corporation . since the modular design of the manifold assembly allows for various applications , the components of the present invention can be sold as a kit . for example , several different size collars can be provided in the kit in order to accommodate sample processing devices having different stack heights , such as where deep well filtration plates are used . similarly , numerous different sample processing devices can be provided in the kit , including filtration plates with membranes of different functionality , collection plates , maldi tof targets , support grids , underdrains , washing inserts , etc .']\n",
            "['US-2017369670-A1', 'General tagging of new or cross-sectional technology', 'the present invention is in the field of an improved reusable capture complex and a method of releasable capturing an additive present in a polymer material . the capture complex comprises a catalyst entity , a magnetic nanoparticle , and a bridging moiety solely between the catalyst entity and the magnetic nanoparticle the present use and method provide a high reduction of free additive of a polymer material .', 'the present invention relates in a first aspect to a capture complex and use thereof according to claim 1 . in an example of the present capture complex the nanoparticles are at least one of ferromagnetic particles , anti - ferromagnetic particles , ferrimagnetic particles , synthetic magnetic particles , paramagnetic particles , superparamagnetic particles , such as particles comprising at least one of fe , co , ni , gd , dy , mn , nd , sm , and preferably at least one of o , b , c , n , such as iron oxide , such as ferrite , such as magnetite , hematite , and maghemite . in view of capturing capability magnetite and maghemite are preferred magnetic particles . in view of costs , even when fully or largely recovering the present capture complex , relatively cheap particles are preferred , such as particles comprising fe . in addition non - magnetic nanoparticles could be used , typically oxide comprising particles , such as al 2 o 3 , cao , and clays , such as t - o - t clays and t - o clays . preferably , the nanoparticles are selected so as to be substantially insoluble in the ( alcoholic ) solvents , also at higher temperatures of more than 100 ° c . one oxide that tends to dissolve at higher temperatures in an alcohol such as glycol , is for instance ( amorphous ) sio 2 . it is noted that some sophisticated tailoring may be required . in an example of the present capture complex the bridging moiety comprises a functional group for adhesion or bonding to the nanoparticle and a linking group towards the catalyst entity , and particularly the hetero atom of the aromatic moiety . suitable functional groups are for instance weak organic acid ( such as a carboxylic acid or a dicarboxylic acid ) and silanols , including silanediols and silanetriols . the linking group is for instance an alkyl , such as ethyl , propyl , butyl , pentyl , and hexyl . when forming the present complex he bridging moiety may be introduced as a reactant in the form of a silyl comprising group , such as silylethers , such as triethoxysilylpropylhalide ( such as triethoxysilylpropyl - 3 - chloride . for a weak organic acid the ka typically varies between 1 . 8 × 10 − 16 and 55 . 5 . it has been found that despite negative expectations these bridging groups do not result in a non - acceptable reduced performance , such as a decreasing catalytic performance of the catalyst entity . in an example of the present capture complex the aromatic moiety has at least one tail . the present tail relates to a tail like moiety . the at least one tail preferably having a length of c 1 - c 6 , such as c 2 - c 4 , the at least one tail being attached to the at least one nitrogen atom . it has been found that for an optimal degradation of a polymer a somewhat higher yield is obtained when the present tail is somewhat longer . in terms of mass of capture complex provided it has been found that a somewhat shorter tail is preferred , and also in view of capturing additives too long tails limit capturing . in an example of the present capture complex the magnetic nanoparticle comprises ( per particle ) at least one bridging moiety and catalyst entity , preferably 2 - 10 4 bridging moieties and catalyst entities ( bc per particle ), more preferably 10 - 10 3 bridging moieties and catalyst entities ( bc per particle ). in principle as many catalyst entities as possible may be provided . however the amount of catalyst entities and there functioning is somewhat smaller than an amount that could be achieved . also when a larger particle is selected somewhat more catalyst entities may be present . in an example of the present capture complex the amount of bridging moiety and catalyst ( entity ) attached thereto is 0 . 03 - 99 wt . %, preferably 0 . 1 - 75 wt . %, more preferably 0 . 2 - 25 wt . %, even more preferably 0 . 3 - 10 wt . %, relative to a total weight of capture complex . likewise as above , a relative low amount of 0 . 1 - 5 wt . % of catalyst entity has been found to be optimal , such as 0 . 6 - 3 wt . %, within further boundary conditions such as applied temperature . an amount of catalyst and / or bridging moiety may be determined by tga . it is noted that the present catalyst and bridging moiety may form a single ( mono -) layer , or a part thereof not fully covering the nanoparticle . before applying the present capture complex in the present method it may be washed . the above weight percentages are relative to a total weight of ( dry ) capture complex . in a second aspect the present invention relates to a method according to claim 7 . therein an additive is provided , typically being released from a polymer upon degradation thereof . it has been found that the present method and capture complex are also suited in methods wherein natural polymers are degraded . the additive is preferably captured under addition of an excess ( in terms of capability of capturing ) present capture complex . the excess is determined on a molar basis . the additive is typically hydrophobic of nature . in an example of the present method the additive and complex are present in a hydrophilic solution , such as ethylene glycol and water . the method may further comprise the steps of precipitating the complex and additive , such as by decreasing a temperature ; removing the hydrophilic solution , such as by decanting ; adding a washing agent , such as ch 2 cl 2 ; dissolving the additive in the washing agent , and recovering the complex . as an alternative to precipitation the capture complex may be filtered . with this relative simple method most or virtually all of the additive can be captured and released from the capture complex . in an example , relating to pigments in depolymerized pet ( monomer / bhet ), no remaining pigment could be detected , such as by 1 h nmr . in an example the present method further comprises the step of adding a hydrophilic solution when adding the washing agent , i . e . an organic solvent that is preferably a hydrophobic solvent . therewith a two - phase system is created . as such the hydrophobic additive is separated from e . g . a reaction product . in an example of the present method a polymer provides the additive upon degradation , wherein the polymer is a mixture of waste polymers , the mixture optionally comprising at least one of coloured polymers . with the present method most additives can be captured , and in particular colorants . the capturing process is very effective as no remaining additives could be detected e . g . visually ; for instance a fully clear ( not coloured ) solution or monomer / dimer product was obtained . using uv - vis absorption of specific wavelength disappeared largely . so the present method is capable of handling waste polymers , and even further a mixture of polymers , e . g . having different characteristics , such as a different colour . the yield of degradation and capturing efficiency has been found not to be influenced noticeably . in a further step an active compound , such as carbon black , may be added to capture and remove remaining additives . it is noted that prior art methods at the most can only handle relatively pure waste polymer , and even then results are discouraging . in an example of the present method the polymer may selected from natural polymers , biobased polymers , biodegradable polymers , polymers formed ( directly or indirectly ) from fossil fuels , and combinations thereof . in an example the polymer is at least one of a polyester , a polyether , such as poly - oxymethylene ( pom ), polyethylene glycol ( peg ), polypropylene glycol ( ppg ), polytetramethyleneglycol ( ptmg ), polyethylene oxide ( poe ), polypropylene oxide ( ppo ), polytetrahydrofuran ( pthf ), and polytetramethyleneetherglycol ( ptmeg ), a polypeptide , a polyamide , a polyamine , a polycondensate , preferably a polyester , such as poly carboxylic ester , wherein the poly carboxylic ester is preferably selected from polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ), polyethylene furanoate ( pef ), polybutylene terephthalate ( pbt ), polytrimethylene terephthalate ( ptt ), polyglycolic acid ( pga ), polylactic acid ( pla ), polycaprolactone ( pcl ), polyethylene adipate ( pea ), polyhydroxyalkanoate ( pha ), polyhydroxybutyrate ( phb ), polyethylene naphthalate ( pen ), poly ( 3 - hydroxybutyrate - co - 3 - hydroxyvalerate ) ( phbv ), and a polycondensate of 4 - hydroxybenzoic acid and 6 - hydroxynaphthalene - 2 - carboxylic acid ( vectran ). in other words a large variety of polymers may be degraded by the present method . some adjustments may be necessary , e . g . in terms of catalyst used , temperature applied , solvent used , etc . the present method is best suited for degradation using hydrolysis or glycolysis , such as in degradation of polyesters and polyethers , in particular pet and pef . after degradation the obtained mixture may be cooled down , e . g . to 50 - 85 ° c . at this temperature a magnetic separation may be performed . likewise alternative separation techniques , such as filtering , centrifugation , etc . may be used . thereafter a mixture may be cooled down even further , e . g . to 1 - 10 ° c ., in order to precipitate e . g . a monomer or dimer . the obtained precipitate may further be dried , e . g . at 50 - 75 ° c . in an example of the present method the amount of catalyst complex is 0 . 1 - 35 wt . %, preferably 0 . 5 - 20 wt . %, more preferably 1 - 10 wt . %, even more preferably 2 - 7 wt . %, relative to a total weight of polymer provided , such as ( weight to weight ) 1 abc : 15pet (: 45 eg , ethylene glycol ). if the amount of catalyst is higher a shorter reaction time was obtained , whereas at a lower amount longer reaction times were obtained . depending on further boundary conditions one may vary the amount of catalyst . in an example of the present method the additive has an average size of 1 - 100 nm , and a molecular weight of 10 - 5000 dalton . in particular the following additives can be captured . organic based pigments , such as acridine dyes , anthraquinone dyes , arylmethane dyes , diarylmethane dyes , triarylmethane dyes , azo - dyes , diazonium dyes , nitro dyes , nitroso dyes , phthalocyanine dyes , quinone - imine dyes , azin dyes , eurhodin dyes , safranin dyes , indamins , indophenol dyes , oxazin dyes , oxazone dyes , thiazine dyes , thiazole dyes , xanthene dyes , fluorene dyes , pyronin dyes , fluorone dyes , rhodamine dyes , and derivatives thereof , biological pigments , such as alizarin , alizarin crimson , gamboge , cochineal red , rose madder , indigo , indian yellow , and tyrian purple , and non - biological organic pigments , such as quinacridone , magenta , phthalo green , phthalo blue , pigment red 170 , diarylide yellow , metal - based pigments , such as cadmium pigments , chromium pigments , cobalt pigments , copper pigments , iron oxide pigments , lead pigments , manganese pigments , mercury pigments , titanium pigments , and zinc pigments , and further inorganic pigments , such as carbon pigments , clay earth pigments , and ultramarine pigments , and salts thereof , and combinations thereof . the capture efficiency may vary , depending on the nature of e . g . the pigment , from 25 % to & gt ; 99 . 99 %. in addition freed additives may be captured by other compounds , such as carbon black . in an example of the present method further comprises the step of recovering the catalyst attached to the magnetic particle using an electro - magnetic field gradient , preferably in a magnetic field of 0 . 1 - 5 t , preferably from 0 . 3 - 2 t , more preferably from 0 . 5 - 1 . 5 t , such as 0 . 8 - 1 . 3 t , e . g . 1 t . as such a relatively small magnetic field is found to be sufficient to recover the present capture complex . in view of e . g . reactor design such is advantageous . in an example water is provided , in order to separate the present complex from the present solvent . it has been found that it is much easier to remove the present complex from a water phase , than from the present solvent phase . by providing a suited capture complex , such as the present complex , the catalyst ( complex ) may be recovered . it has been found that typically 95 % of the capture complex can be recovered , and often even 98 - 99 %. as a consequence the present capture complex can be reused 20 - 100 times , thereby e . g . saving costs . it has been found that a recovered capture complex functions equally well compared to a fresh ( non - used ) complex . in an example of the present method further comprises the step of recycling the capture complex . after recovery the present complex can be recycled or removed and e . g . stored for later use . in an example of the present method the polymer is polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ) or pef , the solvent is ethanediol , the catalyst comprises butylimidazole or butylmethylimidazole and fecl 4 − , the bridging moiety is triethoxysilylpropyl or trihydroxysilylpropyl , and the nanoparticle is magnetite and / or maghemite . the nanoparticles preferably have a size of 5 - 10 nm . the bridging moiety preferably is present in an amount of 10 − 4 - 10 2 mole bridging moiety / gr nanoparticle , such as 2 * 10 − 4 - 10 − 3 . it is assumed that if a predetermined amount ( moles ) of bridging moiety is attached to a predetermined amount ( gr ) practically all of the bridging moieties attach to the nanoparticle and substantially stay attached during the present method . such is especially a preferred embodiment in view of the abundant amount of waste pet being available , being in excess of hundreds of thousand tons per year . the present capture complex may for instance be used in a ratio ( weight to weight ) of complex : pet in a range of 1 : 5 to 1 : 500 , such as 1 : 10 - 1 : 15 . in addition the amount of e . g . ethylene glycol : pet may vary from 1 : 2 to 1 : 20 , such as 1 : 3 to 1 : 5 . the waste polymers may relate to a single type of polymer , such as pet , pef , pa , etc ., and also to a mixture thereof . it typically comprises 50 - 99 . 9 wt . % of a specific polymer , such as pet , the remainder being impurities , other polymers , other compounds , etc . the invention is further detailed by the accompanying figures and examples , which are exemplary and explanatory of nature and are not limiting the scope of the invention . to the person skilled in the art it may be clear that many variants , being obvious or not , may be conceivable falling within the scope of protection , defined by the present claims . fig1 a - e shows chemical reactions and capture complexes . fig1 a shows chemical reactions . therein poly ( ethylene terephthalate ) is degraded in 1 , 2 - ethanediol . similar results have been obtained with the capture complex of the present invention ; in an example bim is used as aromatic catalyst entity . as a result terephthalic acid bis ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) ester ( bhet ) is formed . further , it is shown that bhet can be converted into dimers and oligomers ( typically having 3 - 12 monomers ). fig1 b shows a schematic representation of the present capture complex . therein a represents a nanoparticle , such as maghemite , b a bridging moiety directly attached to the nanoparticle , such as trisilanolpropyl , and c a catalyst entity , directly attached to the bridging moiety , with c1 being a positive catalyst moiety , such as bim , and c2 being a negative catalyst moiety , such as cl − . if present ( hence not shown ) a tail would extent away from the nanoparticle . fig1 c shows a nanoparticle a surrounded by a number of bridging moieties and catalyst entities and attached to the nanoparticle . fig1 d shows an example of making one embodiment of the capture complex of the invention . in a first step 3 - chloropropyltriethoxysilane is reacted over night with 1 - butyl - imidazole under heating forming a bc sub - complex ; herein the butyl forms a tail . a temperature is from 320 - 360 ° k , and depending on the temperature a reaction time is from 30 - 360 minutes . the reaction yields almost 100 % bc sub - complex . the bc sub - complex is thereafter grafted on an iron oxide comprising nanoparticle . in this example , due to the presence of the carboxylic acid group , the grafted is understood to result in adhesion . alternatively , in the presence of a silanol group , the grafting may be in the form of chemical bonding . fig1 d and 1 e show reaction equations for formation of the capture complex of the invention in accordance with one preferred embodiment . in a first step ( fig1 d ) 3 - chloropropyltriethoxysilane is reacted over night with 1 - butyl - imidazole under heating forming a bc sub - complex ; herein the butyl may be referred to as a tail . a temperature is from 320 - 470 k , and depending on the temperature a reaction time is from 30 min . to overnight . the reaction yields almost 100 % bc sub - complex . the resulting intermediate is the combination of positively charged n -[ 3 -( triethoxysilyl ) propyl ]- butylimidazolium and negatively charged chloride . subsequently , a lewis acid , such as fecl 3 may be added . however , that is not deemed necessary . in a second step , shown in fig1 e , the ethoxy - groups of the said reaction product thereof are converted to hydroxyl - groups , to result in a silanol - group . in a third step , that is for instance carried out in water or in ethanol or aqueous ethanol , the silanol is reacted with the nanoparticle surface , preferably in the presence of an acid . the resulting capture complex may thereafter be ( re ) dispersed in the desired solvent for the polymer degradation , for instance glycol . tests have been performed on coloured pet and previously for non - coloured pet . the results thereof are in the same order of magnitude for both conversion and selectivity towards bhet . as a consequence inventors conclude that a colour additive has hardly any or no impact in this respect . even further , additives , such as pigments , can be removed from the degradation products , with ease . similar tests as above have been performed on a wide range of raw ( pet ) material , e . g . polyester clothing , pet carpet , pet material from automotive industry , recycled pet , multi - layered pet trays containing other polymers , such as pe and pp . the results thereof are in the same order of magnitude . as a consequence inventors conclude that the process is highly insensitive to different raw ( pet ) material and robust as well . in an example inventors used 1 g of capture complex of fig1 e and 5 g of pet . experiments showed that all colorants were removed by the complex , that is no colour was detectable in the obtained bhet / ethylene glycol ( eg )/ water phase . it has been found that the present complex is capable of removing at least 2 . 5 mg colorant / g complex in one single use ; examples show a removal of 25 mg colorant / g complex in a single run . when used in sequence of e . g . five times it has been found that the complex removes at least 12 . 5 mg colorant / g complex . when used for a large number of sequences ( e . g . up to 50 times ) there is been found no drawback in efficiency ; hence the complex is considered to be capable of removing at least 125 mg / g complex . such a capability is considered enough for most applications considered . in one preferred embodiment , a washing step is per - formed in order to remove the captured compound . advantageously , this washing needs only to be done after a series of runs or cycles if an amount of additive is large relative to the amount of capture complex the capture complex may be washed ; typically the capacity for capturing additives by the complex , as indicated above is relatively large and the complex only needs to be washed after 5 - 10 cycles . an imidazolium based functional acid a piperidinium based functional acid , a pyridinium based functional acid , a pyrrolidinium based functional acid , a sulfonium based functional acid with an additional side group r3 , an ammonium based functional acid with additional side groups r3 and r4 , and a phosphonium based functional acid with additional side groups r3 and r4 ; all with at least side groups r1 and r2 and counter ion x —. x may be selected from f , cl , br , i , dicyanamide , bis ( trifluoromethylsulphonyl ) imide , preferably cl . the functional group r1 may be a ( mono or multi , 1 - 4 ) carboxylic acid , whereas functional group r2 may be an alkane , typically a straight or branched alkane . functional groups r3 and r4 may be selected from h , ch 3 and r1 and r2 . functional groups r1 - r4 have been selected independently and may be ( partly ) the same , or not . the side group r2 may have m or o carbon atoms may be branched , whereas the side group r1 having n ( typically 4 - 20 ) carbon atoms is preferably unbranched . so in summary aromatic and non - aromatic moieties had and have been tested , typically comprising a heteroatom ( n , s , p ), having a positive charge on the ( or one of ) hetero atom ( s ), and various side groups have been tested . the most promising have been claimed , namely the aromatic ones with a nitrogen atom . various metal salt comprising two - or three - plus charged metal ion and negatively charged counter - ions have been tested , especially fe , ca , co , mn , and the above counter ions . for the bridging moiety weak and functionalize acids have been tested , such as a carboxylic acids and an oxysilane , such as methoxysilane or ethoxysilane . various nanoparticles have been tested such as having o as counter ion , and fe , co and mn as metal ion , and some combinations thereof . these function fine . a size is typically relatively small , hence nanoparticles , with a lower value of 2 nm , and an upper value of 500 nm . both have certain minor advantages and disadvantages . most or all of the catalyst can be recovered easily , depending on the method of recovery . after 30 times recovery the amount recovered using magnetic recovery is higher than 98 % of the initial amount , so virtually no losses . if filtration is used even higher amounts can be recovered . the reference scale of a laboratory experiment is 50 g of ethylene glycol ( eg ) in a 100 ml flask . the reference mass ratio of the reaction is 1 g of dry catalyst complex particles : 5 g of pet : 50 g of eg . the reference capture complex comprises 5 nm magnetite nanoparticles , trisilanolpropyl as bridging moiety and as ionic liquid ( bim ) fecl 4 or ( bmim ) fecl 4 ). a reference reaction was executed as follows : the catalyst complex dispersion was homogenised by shaking for 5 minutes by hand . to 10 g of capture complex dispersion 41 g of eg was added and the liquids were shortly mixed by hand to homogenise the dispersion . then , 5 g of pet flakes were added and the round bottom flask was placed in the heating set up . the pet flakes were prepared from colored pet bottles commercially available from spa ®, as spa ® reine ( blue in blue colored pet bottles ) and spa ® sparkling ( red in red colored pet bottles ). the heating was started and after 20 minutes , the reaction mixture had reached the reaction temperature of 150 - 200 ° c . the reaction was followed in time by taking in - process - control samples to measure the concentration of bhet produced as a function of time . the concentration of bhet was determined with hplc . the results are listed in table 1 . it was found that the reaction conditions ( temperature , concentration of capture complex , type and size of nanoparticle ) could be varied in sufficient broad ranges . after the depolymerisation reaction , water was added in a 1 : 1 ratio and the capture complex was separated from the liquid stream containing the monomer by magnetic separation . the liquid phase was decanted , leaving the capture complex as a slurry - like layer on the bottom of the beaker . the capture complex could be easily redispersed with ethylene glycol . to release the colorants from the capture complex , an organic solvent , in this example ch2cl2 was added and stirred vigorously . the capture complex was magnetically sedimented leaving a clear red or blue supernatant , dependent on the type of bottle used for the flakes . the supernatant could be decanted and the capture complex could be redispersed in ethylene glycol again . examples 2 and 3 were repeated using a white pet bottles , that contained white - colored pigment , apparently tio 2 . however , when the magnetic sedimentation was performed in the presence of the organic solvent to release the pigment , the liquid phase was left with the sedimented capture complex . this was left to stand overnight and a white layer of pigment particles had sedimented overnight on top of the capture complex sediment . an alkyl imidazole is mixed with a halogensilane in a 1 : 1 molar ratio and stirred at a slightly elevated temperatures for 8 hours . the nanoparticles are prepared based on the method first described by massart et al . in 1981 : an fe ( ii ) solution is mixed with a fe ( iii ) solution in a 1 : 2 molar ratio respectively . the iron oxide nanoparticles are formed by a co - precipitation reaction in basic medium while stirring . subsequently , the resulting iron oxide particles are washed water and ethanol . next , an adequate amount of linker - catalyst complex diluted with ethanol is mixed well with the dispersion of iron oxide particles , after which ammonia added . the reaction mixture is stirred for 15 hours . depending on a ratio between linker - catalyst and nanoparticle an amount of linker - catalyst per nanoparticle may vary . the particles are washed with acetone prior to redispersion in ethylene glycol . the invention although described in detailed explanatory context may be best understood in conjunction with the accompanying examples and figures . it should be appreciated that for commercial application it may be preferable to use at least one variations of the present system , which would similar be to the ones disclosed in the present application and are within the spirit of the invention .']\n",

top box that receives a stream of image information from a remote device ( e . g ., a content provider might transmit a stream that includes information about high - definition image frames to the set - top box through a cable or satellite network ). fig1 is a block diagram of a media system 100 including a media server 110 that provides image information to a remote media player 120 through a communication network 130 . according to some embodiments , the encoders 114 and / or video processing system 140 ( e . g ., along with a memory unit 150 ) of the media player 120 may use algorithms to reduce the amount of information that needs to be transmitted in order to represent an image . that is , the encoders 114 may reduce the amount of data that is required to represent image content 112 before the data is transmitted by a transmitter 116 as a stream of image information . as used herein , information may be encoded and / or decoded in accordance with any of a number of different protocols . for example , image information may be processed in connection with international telecommunication union - telecommunications standardization sector ( itu - t ) recommendation h . 264 entitled “ advanced video coding for generic audiovisual services ” ( 2004 ) or the international organization for standardization ( iso )/ international engineering consortium ( iec ) motion picture experts group ( mpeg ) standard entitled “ advanced video coding ( part 10 )” ( 2004 ). unlike typical a vlc algorithm , which decodes a symbol directly from a bit stream , the cabac approach decodes the symbol from a bin string ( e . g ., bit ) which is computed bin - by - bin from the bit stream . in order to speed up the process , a vlc decoder may read more bits than what the symbol being decoded needs ( and keep the unused bits in an internal buffer for later use ). a cabac decoder , however , shouldn &# 39 ; t read too many bins because it will waste time on the unnecessary computation and may degrade the context variables required by the bin computation if too many bins are derived . in addition to being a relatively slow process , bin - by - bin decoding may result in poor resource sharing because different binarizations , which contain many bin strings and their corresponding syntax element symbols ( se ) and are similar to vlc lookup tables , may need different decoding flows . in h . 264 , for example , 24 syntax elements may use cabac and more than 15 binarizations may be needed . according to h . 264 c reference code , moreover , many cabac binarizations have individual decoding parsers . as a result , implementations may be complex and costly . note that seven of the 24 syntax elements coded with cabac use unary ( u ), truncated unary ( tu ), and unary k - th order exp - golomb ( uegk ) algorithms to create binarizations . some embodiments described herein may provide an efficient methodology to unify the decode process for these algorithms so that a single bin string decoder , instead of seven bin string decoders , may be used . such an approach may , for example , substantially reduce the gate count of the implementation . fig2 is a flow diagram illustrating an h . 264 decoder cabac parsing process for a syntax element ( se ). a 202 , the binarization for a specific se is generated or obtained , and a bin string is null at 204 and 206 . note that the binarization may be similar to a vlc table . with binarization , the encoder may uses it as a lookup table to map the se symbol ( or symbol ) to a bin string and the decoder uses it to find the se symbol by tracing each coming bin data . in the parsing loop , the context index ( ctxidx ) is derived from bin index ( binidx ) at 208 , one bin of the bin string is computed from ctxidx , and a new bin string is created by concatenating the previous bin string with this new bin at 210 . at 212 , the new bin string is compared with all bin strings in binarization . if the new bin string matches with any in the binarization at 212 , the process is done and a se symbol is output . otherwise , the next parsing iteration starts at 206 . note that the h . 264 standard doesn &# 39 ; t define how the computed new bin string ( b 0 , . . . , b bindix ) should be compared with the bin strings in the binarization . if the system compares one bin string in binarization after another , the implementation may be inefficient . for example , the process might compare the bin string n times if there are n symbols in the binarization and an se is not found . similarly , the process would compare up to n * 6 times if a symbol were found in the 6th iteration . assuming a maximum bin length of m , then n * m comparisons may be required . consider , for example , a binarization with 26 se symbols ( n = 26 ) and the maximum bin length is 7 ( m = 7 ), then the worst case would be 26 * 7 = 182 comparisons to decode a symbol . such an approach may be a time consuming process . also note that a cabac bin string may be prone to decoded in a bin - by - bin manner because the bin values are computed one - by - one . therefore , a “ serial search approach ” may be appropriate for cabac bin string decoding . the serial search approach may process an input bit - stream serially , one bit at a time , and utilize a constructed “ serial search tree .” fig3 illustrates an encode table 310 that maps symbols to bit strings and an associated serial search tree 320 . starting from the root of the tree 320 , the approach traverses , depending on the bit value , the branches of the tree 320 until it a terminal leaf is reached . at the terminal leaf , the code word is fully decoded , and the corresponding symbol can be output . the process then repeats , starting at the root of the tree 320 , for the next symbol . in the worst case , the approach needs to search m times in order to get a symbol , where m is the longest bit length . in some cases , the serial search tree is converted using a serial search table stored in a buffer for a software or hardware implementation . fig4 , for example , is a serial search table 400 associated with the encode table 310 and serial search tree 320 of fig3 . note that mapping the decoding tree 320 to the search table 400 to be stored in a buffer might not be a straightforward task . referring to the search table 400 , the “ input ” is the bit , or bin and the “ node ” represents an intermediate point before a symbol is determined . the buffer memory address is composite of the node and input values . there are two fields in the buffer data “ nodesym ” and “ flag .” nodesym contains either the next node number or the symbol ( represented with [ x ] in the search table ). the flag value indicates whether the symbol is found . if flag the flag value is one , the nodesym is a symbol and the search is complete . if the flag value is zero , nodesym represents the appropriate node for the next move . when search starts , the node value is zero , representing the root of serial search tree . after getting an input bit , or bin , the combination of node and input is the address of the search table 400 in the buffer and the nodesym and flag are read out . here is an example of decoding the string “ 101 ” ( referring to the search table 400 of fig4 ): starting with node = 0 and input = 1 , it can be seen that nodesym = 1 and flag = 0 . as a result , address 1 will be the next node . now looking at node = 1 and input = 0 , it can be seen that nodesym = 6 and flag = 0 . as a result , address 6 will be the next node . now using node = 6 and input = 1 , it can be seen that nodesym = d and flag = 1 . thus , “ d ” is the symbol and decoding is complete . comparing the search tree 320 of fig3 and the search table 400 of fig4 , it can be seen that each represent the same tree expressed in different ways . each node has two branches : one represents 1 and the other with 0 . when each reaches the end , a symbol is there . when an intermediate node is reached , the next node can be determined using the next input bit . such a serial search approach may , however , have several disadvantages . for example , the size of the data table required may be substantial ( e . g ., to contain all necessary symbols and search nodes ). usually , the number of entries in the serial search table 400 is between double and triple the number of potential symbols , depending to the encode table . the more symbols , the bigger buffer size is required to store the search table 400 . as a result , it can be difficult to use a serial search scheme for uegk binarization because the number of symbols of the coefficient level of h . 264 is 256 , and uegk can generate a binarization for an unlimited number of symbols . we do need a smaller size of buffer for the hardware implementation . the uegk algorithm used in h . 264 cabac coding is for the syntax elements of motion vectors , ueg3 with ucoff = 3 , and coefficient absolute levels , ueg0 with ucoff = 14 . the uegk algorithm is the superset of tu and exp - golomb algorithms , which are often used in h . 264 video coding , because the uegk combines the tu and exp - golomb , the former is the prefix part while the latter is suffix part of uegk . consider , for example , fig5 which is table 500 illustrating binarizations for ueg3 with ucoff = 9 . the uegk is a function of “ ucoff ” and “ k .” the ucoff value represents the length of tu while the k value indicates the order of exp - golomb . the table 500 includes the first 40 symbols of the binarization for ueg3 with ucoff = 9 . note that a sign bit may follow the uegk bin string ( but is not illustrated in fig5 for clarity ). in the table 500 , the first 9 se symbols ( se 0 through 8 ), use tu with ucoff = 9 to encode or decode while the rest of the se symbol &# 39 ; s use the 3th order exp - golomb . in other words , the first 9 se symbols only have prefix bins while the rest have 9 1 &# 39 ; s as the prefix bin and several suffix bins coded by eg3 algorithm . ( the suffix bins are illustrated in bold in fig5 ). the following pseudo code , adapted from itu - t recommendation h . 264 , illustrates how to generate the suffix of uegk binarization . where , the sufs = symbol value − ucoff . this pseudo code illustrates that the suffix bins starts from a number of leading 1 &# 39 ; s , followed by a leading 0 , followed by a number of extra bins . assume the number of leading 1 &# 39 ; s is n 1 and the number of extra bins is n e , then n e = k + n 1 . for instance , for symbols se 9 through 16 in the table 500 , the n 1 = 0 and n e = k + 0 = 3 ; there is no leading 1 but a leading 0 . the extra bins starts from 000 to 111 . for symbols se 17 through 32 in the table 500 , n 1 = 1 and n e = k + 1 = 4 . the leading bits are 10 , one leading 1 and one leading 0 , and the extra bins are from 0000 to 1111 . for symbols se 33 through 64 , the leading bits are 110 , 2 leading 1 &# 39 ; s and 1 leading 0 , and the extra bins are from 00000 to 11111 . note that the binarization generated by uegk with ucoff algorithm may have the following characteristics : 1 ) for the symbols between 0 and ( ucoff − 1 ), the bin strings may have only a prefix part , which includes a number of leading 1 &# 39 ; s followed by a 0 . the number of leading 1 &# 39 ; s may be equal to the symbol value . 2 ) for the symbols greater than or equal to ucoff , the bin strings may consist of a prefix and a suffix part : a ) the prefix may be ucoff number of 1 &# 39 ; s . b ) the suffix may be coded with kth order exp - golomb . in additions , the following features of the suffix of the bin string or the kth order exp - golomb code may be noted : 1 ) extra bins with a given length may be lexicographically consecutive with increment 1 . 2 ) symbols for the bin strings with a given extra bin length may also be consecutive with increment 1 . 3 ) the extra bins , which are following to the leading 0 , may have all values from all 0 &# 39 ; s to all 1 &# 39 ; s . for example , the extra bin length for the se symbols 9 through 16 is 3 and their extra bin values are from 000 to 111 ; the extra bin length for se symbols 17 through 32 is 4 and their extra bin values are from 0000 to 1111 . with the mentioned features of the uegk , some embodiments may implement a serial search scheme that may require a substantially smaller buffer for decoding . for example , there may be a very close relationship between the extra bin values and the symbol values . for a given bin length , if the symbol for the smallest extra bin value for a given length is know , then all other symbol values with the same extra bin length may be determined . moreover , extra bins may cover all possible values for a given extra length . as a result , all possible strings with the same bin length might share a single leaf of a search tree . according to some embodiments , a uegk search tree can be constructed without having leaves for every se symbol in the binarization . that is , the tree might use a small number of leaves for the base symbols . for example , fig6 is a uegk search tree 600 associated with the binarizations of fig5 according to some embodiments ( is a uegk search tree for uegk with ucoff = 9 ). the number at the leaf is not the symbol but instead indicates the base symbol along with the extra bin length ( represented as “( base symbol , extra bin length )” in fig6 ). if the extra bin length is 0 , the se symbol is same as the base symbol and bin string decoding completes the process . if the extra bin length is not 0 , the process needs to get a number of extra bins according to the extra bin length , convert the bins to decimal values , and then add to the base symbol to obtain the se symbol . if the extra bin length is m , for example , then the decoder needs to get an extra m bins . using the bin string “ 1111 1111 1010 1 ” as an example . the 1st 9 1 &# 39 ; s drive the traverse to arrive at node “ a ” in fig6 , and the next 0 makes it reach leaf ( 9 , 3 ). the base symbol value is 9 , the extra 3 bins are interpreted as 5 , and the final se symbol is 9 + 5 = 14 . according to some embodiments , an appropriate uegk search table is built and saved in the buffer of a uegk binarization decoder . the following pseudo code describes one method of building such a uegk search table referred to as uegktree [ ]. each element of the uegktree [ ] contains three members , nodesym , ext , and flag : let all serialsearch [ ]. nodesym = − 1 . // the nodesym = − 1 let newnode = 1 . // represents unused node for every bin string in a binarization { get one bin string . let node = 0 . for every bin [ n ] in the bin string , where n = 0 , 1 , ...( maximum bin length − 1 ) { addr = node & lt ;& lt ; 1 . if ( bin [ n ] value is 1 ) { addr = addr + 1 . if ( uegktree [ addr ]. nodesym = − 1 ) { let uegktree [ addr ]. nodesym = node = newnode . set uegktree [ addr ]. flag = 0 ; newnode = newnode + 1 . } else node = uegktree [ addr ]. nodesym } else { // if bin [ n ] value is 0 , set uegktree [ addr ]. flag = 1 ; if ( n & lt ; ucoff ) { uegktree [ addr ]. ext = 0 ; uegktree [ addr ]. nodesym = n ; } else { uegktree [ addr ]. ext = e = n − ucoff ; uegktree [ addr ]. nodesym = ucoff + 2 ( k + e ) − 2k ; } break the inner for - loop ; } n = n + 1 . } } 1 ) each bin of each bin string in a uegk binarization travels the search tree ( still being constructed ) from the root to one leaf . 2 ) if the bin value is 1 , the process has reached a node . if it is an used node , it takes that node number ; otherwise , a new node number is assigned to the node . the node number may be combined with coming bin value for the next move . 3 ) if the bin value is 0 , it has reached a leaf . if it is a prefix bin , and there are no more extra bins , then the symbol is equal to the bin number ; otherwise , the extra bin length and the base symbol value are evaluated . 4 ) when all bins of all bin strings complete the traveling , the appropriate node numbers , base symbols , extra bin lengths and flags are then assigned to all nodes and leafs . fig7 is a uegk search table 700 associated with the search tree 600 of fig6 according to some embodiments . in particular , fig7 illustrates the first 24 entries of the uegk search table 700 for the binarization of ueg3 with ucoff = 9 . to decode 64 symbols , the uegk search scheme might only require 24 entries as compared to a conventional serial search scheme which might need about 128 or more entries . note that , in the nodesym columns in the search table 700 , the numbers in [ ] represent the base symbols ; otherwise , the numbers are node numbers . the uegk search table 700 might be built off - line and stored to a local buffer of a cabac decoder before starting the process . in such cases , building the table might not affect the performance of the decoder . according to some embodiments , decoding the bin string may be substantially simpler than building the uegk search table 700 . fig8 is a flow diagram illustrating a method of decoding the bin string according to some embodiments . the method may be performed , for example , by the video processing system 140 of fig1 . the flow charts described herein do not necessarily imply a fixed order to the actions , and embodiments may be performed in any order that is practicable . note that any of the methods described herein may be performed by hardware , software ( including microcode ), firmware , or any combination of these approaches . for example , a storage medium may store thereon instructions that when executed by a machine result in performance according to any of the embodiments described herein . at 802 , a decoder may input bin data . the bin data may then be used at 804 to compute a search table address . at 806 , the search table address is used to read the contents ( flag , ext , and nodesym ) from the search table buffer . if the value of flag is not “ 1 ” at 808 , the process continues to input bin data at 802 . if the value of flag is “ 1 ” at 808 , the decoder may input a number of extra bins , according to the ext value , and compute the symbol value at 810 . for example , the following pseudo code may demonstrated the binarization decoder according to some embodiments : read nodesym , ext , and flag from address of ( node * 2 + bin ) using bin string “ 1111 1111 1010 1 ” again as example , the above pseudo code and the uegk search table 700 of fig7 may demonstrate how to derive the appropriate symbol value : 1 ) the address after inputting the 1st ‘ 1 ’ is 1 ( 0 + 1 = 1 ) and it contains flag = 0 and node = 1 . 2 ) the address after inputting the 2nd ‘ 1 ’ is 3 ( 1 * 2 + 1 = 3 ) and it contains flag = 0 and node = 2 . the process continues similarly unit the address after inputting the 9th ‘ 1 ’ is 19 ( 8 * 2 + 1 = 17 ) and it contains flag 0 and node = 9 . 3 ) finally , the 1st ‘ 0 ’ is input and the address becomes 18 ( 9 * 2 + 0 = 18 ) and it gets flag = 1 , nodesym = 9 , and ext = 3 . 6 ) the last extra bin is 1 and n = 2 * 2 + 1 = 5 . therefore , the symbol = 9 + 5 = 14 . thus , some embodiments of the uegk bin string decoder described herein may provide a substantially smaller table size . for example , the required buffer size may be one fifth as compared to a conventional serial search scheme for the 1 st 64 symbols of the ueg9 binarization with ucoff = 9 . in case of search first 128 symbols of the same binarization , some embodiments may use a table with only 26 entries while a conventional serial search scheme might require a table with about 256 entries . note that such improvements may increase as the binarization size increases . also note that some embodiments of the uegk bin string decoder described herein may support other types of binarizations . for example , according to the h . 264 specifications , seven of the 24 syntax elements that are coded by cabac use u , tu , and uegk algorithms to create the binarizations . all of those binarizations might share the same hardware architecture ( because the u and tu are subsets of uegk ). fig9 is a block diagram of a system 900 according to some embodiments . the system 900 may be associated with , for example , a digital display device , a television , a digital video recorder , a game device , a personal computer ( pc ), a wireless device , and / or a set - top box . the system 900 may include , for example , a decoder engine 910 and a search table buffer according to any of the embodiments described herein . according to some embodiments , the system 900 outputs a digital display signal via a digital display output port 930 . the following illustrates various additional embodiments . these do not constitute a definition of all possible embodiments , and those skilled in the art will understand that many other embodiments are possible . further , although the following embodiments are briefly described for clarity , those skilled in the art will understand how to make any changes , if necessary , to the above description to accommodate these and other embodiments and applications . for example , although embodiments have been described herein with respect to a particular video encoding protocol , note embodiments could be associated with other video encoding protocol and / or non - video encoding protocols . moreover , although particular tables , values , and pseudo code have been used as examples , other approaches could be used instead to implement any of the embodiments described herein . the several embodiments described herein are solely for the purpose of illustration . persons skilled in the art will recognize from this description other embodiments may be practiced with modifications and alterations limited only by the claims .']\n"
